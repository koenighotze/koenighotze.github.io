Obviously books are one great way to benefit from the experience of other people. This is true for recipe-collections that teach how to bake a really good chocolate cake and this is especially true for computer science and programming in general.

In this post I want to look back at a couple of books, that - in hindsight - proved to have great impact on my professional career. I have ordered the books by the time I have read them, without any real guarantee that I am always correct.

I use a simple template for each book:

- _Title_: should be clear
- _Authors_: ...also clear
- _Short description_: what is subject of the book in three sentences
- _When and why?_: when did I read the book and what was the driver in buying and reading
- _What's the impact?_:
- _Would I read it again?_:


C Programming Language k&r

Scheme book

Korn Shell

Perl

Refactoring

Pragmatic Programmer

Mythical Man Month

Template Zombies

Enterprise application design

JEE without EJB

Enterprise Java

Patterns of EAI

Domain Driven Design

Reactive Design Patterns




# So what?

Well, naturally books that deal with the craft in itself age better. But even technical manuals, that may seem dated today (Perl :(), where essential and valuable.
