# The fatal downward spiral of bad software quality

{:.no_toc}

This short post is about taking shortcuts in sofware development and the sometimes severe consequences. Note that I have changed all names and details, to protect the (maybe not so) innocent.

A couple of weeks ago, I took part in a workshop with some project managers and technical architects of one of our customers from the financial industry. The workshop was thought of as some kind of retrospective of the last year and their current situation.

The project manager, let's call her She-Ra, described the situation as follows...

_"The programme started in 2017 as a major effort to move towards a new commercial-of-the-shelf platform for our business. The near shore developers - stationed in Barcelona - were asked to integrate our current systems and applications with the new external system. As expected, the requirements and details changed heavily during the year, but because we are using Scrum, we could handle those changes easily._



_Now the build has been broken for somewhere around two weeks and we are not sure why and how to fix it. But the teams are working on it. So, how can we keep up our current excelent velocity?"_

Puh.

CI CD
Unit Test
Scrum + Microtracking
Death March
Scope (Fixed deadline, Fixed Scope, ) -> takes experience to do this agile
Remote teams / business in Germany
Responsibility of TL to insist on quality.
Shortcuts lead to death (like in horror movies)
